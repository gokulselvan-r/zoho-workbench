# Zoho Workbench

Workbench is a powerful, web-based suite of tools designed for administrators and developers to interact with crm.zoho.com organizations via the Force.com APIs. Workbench includes robust support for the Force.com Partner, Bulk, Rest, Streaming, Metadata, and Apex APIs that allows users to describe, query, manipulate, and migrate both data and metadata in zoho.com organizations directly in their web browser with a simple and intuitive user interface. Workbench also provides many advanced features for testing and troubleshooting the Force.com APIs, backward compatibility testing with previous API versions, and single sign-on integration within the Zoho application.
